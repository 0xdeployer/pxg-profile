# PXG.eth Profile React App

## What is this?

PXG.eth domains are extended ENS names which include built in functionality for verified NFT avatars. This app acts as a public facing NFT profile and also allows you to manage your PXG.eth name. There is a backend server set up which stores things like profile links in a traditional database. The backend server also provides convenient APIs to fetch information about a PXG.eth name so users are not required to have something like MetaMask to view the profiles.

Profiles can be accessed via https://pxg.wtf/:name. For example: [https://pxg.wtf/nftboi](https://pxg.wtf/nftboi)

Each PXG.eth name is an NFT. This is how ownership is tracked. The resolving address of the name will always be the owner of the NFT. You can view existing names on OpenSea [https://opensea.io/collection/pxg-eth](https://opensea.io/collection/pxg-eth)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and immediately ejected :) It uses TypeScript.
